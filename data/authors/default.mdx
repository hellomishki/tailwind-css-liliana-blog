Hey there! I’m Liliana, a software engineer, lifelong gamer, and tech enthusiast with roots in Portugal and a heart that’s explored much of Australia. My family migrated to Australia in 1992, and since then, I’ve lived everywhere from the coast to the outback, but these days you’ll find me coding away in Melbourne.

I’ve been tinkering with code since the days of Geocities—when building a website meant trial, error, and a lot of HTML tags. Being online in the ’90s and 2000s was a wild ride, and I’ve been hooked on the possibilities of the internet ever since. Back then, I spent just as much time customizing my website as I did diving into online communities and forums, where the web felt a little more wild and free.

When I wasn’t figuring out how to make text blink or hosting my favorite music on my site, I was gaming—starting with the Sega Master System. From those pixelated classics to modern immersive worlds, gaming has always been a part of who I am. It’s where my love for problem-solving, creativity, and all things tech really began.

After years of self-teaching and exploring the digital world, I officially became a software engineer in 2016. Since then, I’ve been creating clean, efficient code and building web experiences that I hope reflect the same excitement and curiosity that first drew me to this field. From custom-built websites to open-source contributions, my goal is to turn ideas into reality while keeping that nostalgic spark from my early days of coding alive.

When I’m not writing code, you can find me playing the latest RPG, tweaking my Linux setup, or diving into the next tech challenge. Welcome to my digital space—I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I’ve enjoyed building it!
